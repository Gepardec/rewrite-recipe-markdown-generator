## New Recipes
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.JavaVersion20](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/migrate/javaversion20): Change maven.compiler.source and maven.compiler.target values to 20. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.UpgradeToJava20](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/migrate/upgradetojava20): This recipe will apply changes commonly needed when migrating to Java 20. This recipe will also replace deprecated API with equivalents when there is a clear migration strategy. Build files will also be updated to use Java 20 as the target/source and plugins will be also be upgraded to versions that are compatible with Java 20. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.lang.UseTextBlocks](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/migrate/lang/usetextblocks): Text blocks are easier to read than concatenated strings. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.search.FindImplementations](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/search/findimplementations): Find source files that contain a class declaration implementing a specific interface. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.AddRouteTrailingSlash](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/spring/boot3/addroutetrailingslash): This is part of Spring MVC and WebFlux URL Matching Changes, as of Spring Framework 6.0, the trailing slash matching configuration option has been deprecated and its default value set to false. This means that previously, a controller `@GetMapping("/some/greeting")` would match both `GET /some/greeting` and `GET /some/greeting/`, but it doesn't match `GET /some/greeting/` anymore by default and will result in an HTTP 404 error. This recipe is to add declaration of additional route explicitly on the controller handler (like `@GetMapping("/some/greeting", "/some/greeting/")`. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.AddSetUseTrailingSlashMatch](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/spring/boot3/addsetusetrailingslashmatch): This is part of Spring MVC and WebFlux URL Matching Changes, as of Spring Framework 6.0, the trailing slash matching configuration option has been deprecated and its default value set to false. This means that previously, a controller `@GetMapping("/some/greeting")` would match both `GET /some/greeting` and `GET /some/greeting/`, but it doesn't match `GET /some/greeting/` anymore by default and will result in an HTTP 404 error. This recipe is change the default with the global Spring MVC or Webflux configuration. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.MaintainTrailingSlashURLMappings](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/spring/boot3/maintaintrailingslashurlmappings): This is part of Spring MVC and WebFlux URL Matching Changes, as of Spring Framework 6.0, the trailing slash matching configuration option has been deprecated and its default value set to false. This means that previously, a controller `@GetMapping("/some/greeting")` would match both `GET /some/greeting` and `GET /some/greeting/`, but it doesn't match `GET /some/greeting/` anymore by default and will result in an HTTP 404 error. This recipe is to maintain trailing slash in all HTTP url mappings. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.security6.MavenPomUpgrade](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/spring/security6/mavenpomupgrade): Upgrade Maven POM to Spring Security 6.0 from prior 5.x version. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.security6.PropagateAuthenticationServiceExceptions](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/spring/security6/propagateauthenticationserviceexceptions): Remove any calls matching `AuthenticationEntryPointFailureHandler.setRethrowAuthenticationServiceException(true)`. See the corresponding [https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/6.0.0/migration/servlet/authentication.html#_propagate_authenticationserviceexceptions](Sprint Security 6.0 migration step) for details. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.security6.UpgradeSpringSecurity_6_0](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/spring/security6/upgradespringsecurity_6_0): Migrate applications to the latest Spring Security 6.0 release. This recipe will modify an application's build files, make changes to deprecated/preferred APIs, and migrate configuration settings that have changes between versions. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.security6.UseSha256InRememberMe](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/spring/security6/usesha256inrememberme): As of Spring Security 6.0 the SHA-256 algorithm is the default for the encoding and matching algorithm used by `TokenBasedRememberMeServices` and does thus no longer need to be explicitly configured.See the corresponding [https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/6.0.0/migration/servlet/authentication.html#servlet-opt-in-sha256-rememberme](Sprint Security 6.0 migration step) for details. 
* [org.openrewrite.maven.RenamePropertyKey](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/maven/renamepropertykey): Rename the specified Maven project property key leaving the value unchanged.
